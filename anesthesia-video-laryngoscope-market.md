<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthesia video laryngoscope market is divided into two main types: channelled and un-channelled video laryngoscopes. Channelled video laryngoscopes feature a built-in channel for an endotracheal tube, facilitating easier and more controlled intubation in difficult airway situations. In contrast, un-channelled video laryngoscopes lack this channel, offering a more traditional, direct visualization approach for intubation without the added complexity. Both types are essential for enhancing airway management and improving patient outcomes during surgery and emergency procedures.</p></p>
