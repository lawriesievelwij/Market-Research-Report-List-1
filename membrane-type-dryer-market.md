<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Type Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The membrane type dryer market is divided into two main categories: porous and non-porous membranes. Porous membranes allow selective permeability, enabling the passage of specific gases while retaining others, making them ideal for various gas separation processes. In contrast, non-porous membranes do not permit any permeation of gas molecules, and are typically used for applications requiring higher purity and efficiency. Both types serve distinct roles in industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and food processing, tailoring solutions to specific drying and separation needs.</p></p>
