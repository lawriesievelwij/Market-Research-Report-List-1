<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatrics orthoses market includes two primary types of helmets: active and passive. Active helmets are designed to actively reshape a child's skull through pressure distribution, often used in cases of craniosynostosis or positional plagiocephaly. These helmets typically involve ongoing adjustments to facilitate proper growth. Conversely, passive helmets provide a more supportive role, maintaining the skull's shape without continuous adjustments, and are mainly used for mild cases. Both types aim to promote healthy cranial development in infants.</p></p>
